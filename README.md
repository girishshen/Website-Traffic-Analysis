**Key Features and Analysis Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, session aggregation, and timestamp normalization.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute metrics for page views, unique users, session duration, and bounce rate.
3. **Visualization:** Generate time series plots, heatmaps, and flow diagrams to explore traffic trends.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and evaluate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for future traffic predictions.
5. **Reporting:** Export interactive dashboards and summary reports.
